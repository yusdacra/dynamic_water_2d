# dynamic_water_2d

simple sideview water for Godot that reacts to forces applied to it.

## usage

get it from the [asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3246).

clone the repository and copy over the addon.
the `water.tscn` scene in the addon is a preset that should work by default.
